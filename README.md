# How Under 5 Mortality Rate has Changed Over Time ![Tableau](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tableau-E97627.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Tableau&logoColor=white) 
This Tableau dashboard provides a detailed analysis of how the under-5 mortality rate has evolved across various countries and income groups over time. The interactive visualisation enables users to track the changes in child mortality rates and observe the disparities based on country wealth and geography.


## Project Overview
This project visualises child mortality data, focusing on the under-5 mortality rate across different time periods, income levels, and countries. The dashboard offers insights into which countries and income groups have made the most progress in reducing child mortality, while also highlighting countries with the highest and lowest child mortality rates.

The dashboard allows users to interactively explore:

- The evolution of under-5 mortality rates across different country income groups.
- Country-specific child mortality trends over time.
- A world map showing child mortality rates filtered by year.

## Key Insights
- **Mortality by Income Group**: The dashboard shows that high-income countries have consistently maintained the lowest child mortality rates, while low-income countries show a much higher mortality rate, despite gradual improvement over time.
- **Notable Countries**: The highest child mortality rate recorded in the data is from Barbados in 1906, with a rate of 68.21, whereas San Marino had the lowest rate recorded in 2021, with a rate of 0.1717.
- **Country Trends**: Countries like India and China experienced significant decreases in child mortality over the years, with both making considerable progress after the 1950s. The UK, US, and other high-income nations show consistently low rates.

## Features
- **Child Mortality Based on Country Wealth**: A line graph categorises child mortality rates based on country income (low-income, lower-middle-income, upper-middle-income, and high-income countries), showing trends from 1990 to 2021.
- **Historical Child Mortality by Country**: A line chart tracking child mortality for key countries, allowing for a closer analysis of individual country trends over time.
- **World Map Visualisation**: A choropleth map displaying child mortality rates across the world for a selected year. Darker shades indicate higher mortality rates.
- **Country Filters**: Users can filter the map and graphs by individual countries or groups of countries, making it easier to analyse specific data points.

## Technologies Used
- **Tableau**: For creating and designing the interactive visualisations.
- **Excel**: Data storage and preprocessing.

## How to Use the Dashboard
To explore the dashboard:

- **Year Filter**: Use the year slider to view changes in child mortality rates across different time periods.
- **Country Filter**: Select specific countries from the dropdown to see individual trends on the line charts and on the world map.
- **Interactive Map**: Hover over countries on the map to get detailed information on their child mortality rates for the selected year.
